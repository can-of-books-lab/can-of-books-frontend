## Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - We are both available as needed.
- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - Slack seems to work well. 
- How often will you take breaks?
  - 10 min break per hour
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Use the 15 min rule and put in a help ticket if necessary.

## Cooperative

- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
  - Tanner: Back end and excellent high level knowledge. 
  - Andres: Front end design in particular and debugging (sometimes).
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  - We can leverage our own individual strengths to help strengten eachother's weak points while at the same time utilizing these strengths in the production of our app.
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Andres: The back end!
  - Tanner: The front end!
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  - Before lab each day we will have a stand up meeting to go over the previous day's activities and to plan out what we hope to accomplish for that lab. 

## Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - Make sure to go over any blockers or areas of concern during our stand up. At that point we could work together to resolve any potential issues before they snowball.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - We will make sure to switch roles of driver/navigator often so that everyone has a chance at both jobs.
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Lean into the team embracing the fact that this is a team effort, and a team project where both people are valued and will contribute.
